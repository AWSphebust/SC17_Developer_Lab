# SC17 Xilinx Developer Lab

Welcome to the SC17 Xilinx Developer Lab. During this session you will gain hands-on experience with AWS F1 and learn how to develop accelerated applications using the AWS F1 OpenCL flow and the Xilinx SDAccel development environment.

This developer lab is divided in 3 modules. It is recommended to complete each module before proceeding to the next.

##### 1. Connecting to your F1 instance - The Setup Lab

In this initial section, you will start a pre-configured EC2 F1 instance and connect to it using a remote desktop client. Once connected, you will download the Lab files and confirm you can execute a simple application on F1.

##### 2. Experiencing F1 acceleration - The FFmpeg Lab

AWS F1 instances are ideal to accelerate complex workloads. In this module you will experience the potential of F1 by using FFmpeg to run both a software implementation and an F1-optimized implementation of an H.265/HEVC encoder. 

##### 3. Developing and optimizating F1 applications with SDAccel - The IDCT Lab

In this module, you will use the SDAccel development environment to create, profile and optimize an F1 accelerator. The lab focuses on the Inverse Discrete Cosine Transform (IDCT), a compute intensive function use at the heart of all video codecs.

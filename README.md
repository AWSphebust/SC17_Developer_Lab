# Xilinx Developer Lab - SC17

Welcome to the Xilinx developer lab at SC17.
During this session you will gain hands-on experience with AWS accelerated applications leveraging FPGA devices.

Let's get started...

## 1. Setup

In this initial section, you will access an F1 instance through "remote desktop", load lab design files and access the instructions. Finally you will run your first accelerated vector addition design to confirm the system is setup as expected.

## 2. The IDCT Lab

The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and its inverse (IDCT) transform time domain signals or images into spectral data. This  transformation allows very efficient compression algorithms used in most video codec.

## 3. The FFMPEG Lab

The FFMPEG framework provides the infrastructure and implementation to effectively work with a wide variety of codecs. This framework is introduced in this tutorial and it is shown how to effectively integrate hardware accelerated algorithms.

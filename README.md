# Xilinx Developer Lab - SC17

Welcome to the Xilinx developer lab at SC17.
During this session you will gain hands-on experience with AWS accelerated applications leveraging FPGA devices.

Let's get started...

## 1. Session setup

In this section, you will access an EC2 F1 machine pre-configured with Gnome. You will "remote desktop" to that machine and load the Lab design files and instructions.
[Setting up the session](Setup.md).

## 2. Running "hello world"

Running a basic vector addition example showcases the main verification phases (software and hardware emulation) and runs the AFI (Amazon FPGA Image) on the FPGA target. Link to the [Hello World Lab](Hello_World_Lab.md)

## 3. The IDCT Lab

The Inverse DCT transform is at the base of the majority of video codecs, it's the crucial transformation from time to frequency domain that allows very efficient compression.

## 4. The FFMPEG Lab

To be deployed at a later date...

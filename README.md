# Xilinx Developer Lab

Welcome to the Xilinx developer Lab at SC17.
During this session you gain hands-on experience with accelerated applications running on FPGAs with AWS.

Let's get started...

## Starting your instance...

We'll first access a pre-configured EC2 machine 

Each participant has been sent an email message a couple of days before the event.
(If you have not received that email, please contact one of the staff members.)

The body of the message contains an URL and that points to the AWS EC2 console management page.
Click on that link...

You should see a page that shows a stopsped instance that you will start (click on "actions" button and select "start" from the pull down.

After a few seconds, an instnce should be started...

## Remote desktop to your instance...
From that instance, you will retrieve the IP address which will be used to remote desktop into.

If you're using Windows, use "remote desktop"
If you're on Linux use remmina (it might not be installed bydefault on your system)

Once the remore desktop witnowd shows, enter the credentials. that answer record egiven in the email.

At this point you shound be able to access the removte EC2 machine and be presented with a Gnome environment.

Once you are in the enviromnnt, you can got clone this area to retrieve the lab files and instructions.

## Access the lab instructions

## Run a basic application to confirm the machine is running as expected

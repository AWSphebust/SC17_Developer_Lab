# Xilinx Developer Lab - SC17

Welcome to the Xilinx developer lab at SC17.
During this session you will gain hands-on experience with AWS accelerated applications leveraging FPGA devices.

Let's get started...

## 1. Session setup

In this initial section, you will access an EC2 F1 machine pre-configured with the Gnome windows environment. You will "remote desktop" to that machine. You will then load the Lab design files and associated instructions.
[Setting up the session](Setup.md).

## 2. Running "hello world"

Running a basic vector addition example showcases the main phases of verification with both the software and hardware emulation.
Then you will run the example on the actual hardware and confirm the final output does match the emulation results.
Note that in order to save time, the AFI (Amazon FPGA Image) was created in advance.

## 3. The IDCT Lab

The Inverse DCT transform is at the base of the majority of video codecs, it's the crucial transformation from time to frequency domain that allows very efficient compression.

## 4. The FFMPEG Lab

To be deployed at a later date...

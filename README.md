# Xilinx Developer Lab - SC17

Welcome to the Xilinx developer lab at SC17.
During this session you will gain hands-on experience with AWS accelerated applications leveraging FPGA devices.

Let's get started...

## 1. Getting Setup

In this initial section, you will access a pre-configured EC2 F1 instance. You will "remote desktop" to that instance. You will then load the Lab design files and associated instructions. Run a basic vector addition design to confirm the system is correctly setup.

## 2. The IDCT Lab

The Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and its inverse (IDCT) transform time domain signals or images into a spatial domain. This  transformation allows very efficient compression algorithms used in most video codec.

## 3. The FFMPEG Lab

The FFMPEG framework provides the infrastructure and implementation to effectively work with a wide variety of codecs. This framework is introduced in this tutorial and it is shown how to effectively integrate hardware accelerated algorithms.
